    Auto merge of #38302 - Mark-Simulacrum:trans-cleanup, r=eddyb
    
    Cleanup old trans
    
    This is a cleanup of old trans, with the following main points:
     - Remove the `build.rs` API (prefer using `Builder` directly, which is now passed where needed through `BlockAndBuilder`).
     - Remove `Block` (inlining it into `BlockAndBuilder`)
     - Remove `Callee::call`, primarily through inlining and simplification of code.
     - Thinned `FunctionContext`:
       - `mir`, `debug_scopes`, `scopes`, and `fn_ty` are moved to `MirContext`.
       - `param_env` is moved to `SharedCrateContext` and renamed to `empty_param_env`.
       - `llretslotptr` is removed, replaced with more careful management of the return values in calls.
       - `landingpad_alloca` is inlined into cleanup.
       - `param_substs` are moved to `MirContext`.
       - `span` is removed, it was never set to anything but `None`.
       - `block_arena` and `lpad_arena` are removed, since neither was necessary (landing pads and block are quite small, and neither needs arena allocation).
     - Fixed `drop_in_place` not running other destructors in the same function.
    
    Fixes #35566 (thanks to @est31 for confirming).
