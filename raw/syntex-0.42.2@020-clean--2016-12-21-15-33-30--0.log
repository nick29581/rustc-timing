    1.14 release notes
    
    [Rendered](https://github.com/brson/rust/blob/relnotes/RELEASES.md).
    
    Is there anything I'm missing? Were there any library stabilizations?
    
    The most interesting thing this time seems to be rustup, then compile time opts, `..` matches, cargo exposing `cfg` values to build scripts. This release also has wasm support, but it's pretty rough. Might be worth hyping up all the same. ARM MUSL targets.
    
    There are a large number of compatibility notes. Might be worth talking about that.
