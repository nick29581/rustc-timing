    libtest: add --exact to make filter matching exact
    
    Filter matching is by substring by default. This makes it impossible
    to run a single test if its name is a substring of some other test.
    For example, its not possible to run just `mymod::test` with these
    tests:
    
    ```
      mymod::test
      mymod::test1
      mymod::test_module::moretests
    ```
    
    You could declare by convention that no test has a name that's a
    substring of another test, but that's not really practical.
    
    This PR adds the `--exact` flag, to make filter matching exactly
    match the complete name.
